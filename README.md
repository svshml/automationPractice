# automationPractice

The qoal of my project is a practice to write some tests by using different types of UI elements. 
demoqa.com is a basic demo site provided by toolsqa.com to learn and practice Selenium. It contains many of the elements that are typical for most websites as elements of a list that are ordered with drag and drop, inputs of different formats, etc.
